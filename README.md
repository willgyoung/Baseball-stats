EDA and practice modeling with baseball data


As part of a preliminary step for one of the jobs I applied for, I was given these datasets and asked a couple questions about them. 
As I have continued to learn more about R I redid them to show my new skillset. 
I'm going to answer the initial questions I was given with the dataset, and explore some other questions I feel would be relevant. 
Additionally I'm also going to try and create some better predictive models than I did the first time with these datasets.
